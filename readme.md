# Isabelle cheat sheets

A collection of really quick and dirty tutorials for making the isabelle theorom prover do what you want

This list of cheat sheets will grow by 1 each time I get frustrated by the quality of documentation in isabelle

(There's lost of PDFs documenting isabelle, and they often fall short of my needs)

## Cheat sheet list

[code_export_project.md](code_export_project.md) "I want to write code in isabelle and export it to Haskell/SML/OCaml/Scala. How do I do that?"

[type_aliases_vs_synonyms.md](type_aliases_vs_synonyms.md) "`type_alias` doesn't work! _or_ How do I define an alias for a type?"
